Elray is a Common Lisp ray-tracer developed on SBCL. Currently Elray
aims to be a research project and not an optimized full-purpose
ray-tracer.

At this point there are essentially spheres and planes that can be
rendered with ambient and diffuse lighting with a given reflectivity
as a material property assigned to an object.

There are some optimizations such as the reliance on Pcall
to execute render lines in parallel on SMP systems. For instance, I
was able to obtain almost a 3x speedup on my quad-core system when
using Pcall.

Here are some links to some test renders:

A more complicated scene with 1000 reflective spheres taking advantage
of the bounding volume hierarchy optimization:
