Elray is a single-precision Common Lisp ray-tracer developed on
SBCL. Currently Elray aims to be a toy research project and not an
optimized full-purpose ray-tracer although there are various
optimizations such as multithreaded rendering and automated bounding
volume hierarchies.

At this point there are essentially spheres and planes that can be
rendered with ambient and diffuse lighting with a given reflectivity
as a material property assigned to an object.

Here are some links to some test renders:

A more complicated scene with 1000 reflective spheres taking advantage
of the bounding volume hierarchy optimization:
